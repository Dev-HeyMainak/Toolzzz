// If we decide to keep RootLayout as a Server Component to export metadata,
// the client-specific logic (like FAB or keyboard shortcuts) would need to be
// in MainLayoutClientBoundary or another dedicated client component.
// For now, making RootLayout a client component for the FAB is simpler.
// But, for metadata export, it should ideally be a Server Component.
// The error regarding metadata export from client component indicates this.

// Let's assume for the sake of this change, we're prioritizing the font and will
// address metadata export strategy separately if needed.
// Actually, the error from the user was about metadata *in* a Client Component layout.
// The `generateMetadata` function approach is for server components.
// For client component layouts, title, etc., are usually set via <Head> or dynamically.
// For simplicity and keeping the current structure, I'll just provide a static title for now if this becomes an issue.
// For now, I'll remove the `export const metadata` as it's not compatible with `"use client"` if it were here.
// The user's error log implies the layout.tsx was the source of the metadata error, so it must have been a server component before.
// I'll keep it as a client component and manage title via a Head tag if needed later.
// The "use client" directive was added to `layout.tsx` due to FAB, which is in `MainLayoutClientBoundary`.
// Let's ensure `layout.tsx` can remain a server component.
// The `MainLayoutClientBoundary` already has "use client".
// The font variables applied to `body` are fine in a server component `layout.tsx`.

// Re-evaluating: The user's error was "You are attempting to export metadata from a component marked with "use client"".
// My last fix created MainLayoutClientBoundary. Let's make sure RootLayout is NOT a client component.
// The `use client` was added to `MainLayoutClientBoundary.tsx` previously.
// This `layout.tsx` should be a Server Component to allow `metadata` export.
// Removing "use client" from *this* file.
